# YouTube Clone

#### A direct clone of the popular video hosting and viewing site, YouTube.

#### by Kevin Ahn

## Description

This web app is a clone of the site [YouTube](https://www.youtube.com "YouTube Homepage") and is made with React, Redux and the YouTube Data API v3. On here, you are able to search for videos, watch videos and see the comments for the videos. The goal of this project was to clone YouTube as closely and as accurately as possible to showcase my ability to take a wireframe or template and translate that into a functioning and visually identical web app.

## Installation

First go signup and obtain an API from YouTube, following the instructions on this site : [Obtain YouTube API key](https://developers.google.com/youtube/v3/getting-started)

Then, clone the repo from github to your machine

```
git clone https://github.com/kevinahn7/youtube-clone.git
```

Then, navigate into the directory

```
cd youtube-clone/
```

On the top level directory, create a file called ".env" and then put this in that file:  
```REACT_APP_API_KEY="Your API key"```

This program is dependent that you already have node installed on your machine and node package manager. Afterwards run the install command.

```
npm install
```
To run the application, run the start command from the root directory.

```
npm run start
```
